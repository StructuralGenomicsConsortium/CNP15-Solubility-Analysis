# CNP15-Solubility-Analysis

An [SGC]((https://www.thesgc.org/)) Open Chemistry Networks Project (number 15) devoted to understanding measured vs predicted solubility for small organic molecules.

We aim to compare measured solubility data with predictions by software, to answer the question "Can we just predict solubility, rather than have to measure it?"

You can contribute! Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple [RULES](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use), you can get started.

For the science background and the story so far, head to the [wiki](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP15-Solubility-Analysis/wiki). For live discussions and recent contributions, head to the [Issues](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP15-Solubility-Analysis/issues) (tab above). Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy.

For answers to all the general questions you have about how these projects work, go to the [FAQs](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/faq).

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an [Issue](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP15-Solubility-Analysis/issues), which is a good way to communicate openly. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask general questions.
